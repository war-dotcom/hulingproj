        <P class="info"> Bobby, a curious young boy, decided to explore an abandoned mansion in his eerie town despite rumors of it being haunted. Unbeknownst to him, the mansion was home to the ghosts of the Holloway family, a once-loving household who mysteriously perished. Unlike vengeful spirits, they simply wished to protect their home and the secrets within. If Bobby was caught, he wouldn’t be harmed—but he might never leave. His adventure soon became a test of trust between the living and the dead. </P>
